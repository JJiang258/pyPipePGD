Analysis of buried pipelines subjected to Permanent Ground Displacements (PGDs).  

## Information
This is a collection of analytical methodologies for the integrity analysis of buried pipelines subjected to Permanent Ground Displacements (PGDs), with emphasis on active seismic fault crossings.  
The available methodologies currently include:
- Continuous pipelines crossing active strike-slip faults.
- Continuous pipelines crossing active normal faults.
- Jointed pipelines crossing active strike-slip faults.
- Jointed pipelines crossing active normal faults.

## Instructions
A series of documented Jupyter notebooks are provided for each case.
